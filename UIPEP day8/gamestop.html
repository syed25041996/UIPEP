            <p><i>This game is awesome! There are many ways to play such as Normal soccer, Hoops (Like normal soccer but the goals are higher and the field is smaller), Snow day (just soccer but with a hockey puck), Dropshot (the goal is in the floor, hit the ball hard to break it into breaking mode and make it touch the opponents' floor, then hit it through the floor!), and finally, rumble (Normal soccer but with power-ups such as: freezing the ball in place, switch places with an opponent, spikes, and many more). The game is free to play now so there is no reason to not get it! If you bought it before it went free (like me), you get all the DLCs for free! You can customize your vehicle, there are many updates to make playing better, There are events that give you exclusive challenges for exclusive items, you can trade items with other people, there is a great chat system (For example on an Xbox One wireless controller, on the + pad you can press left, then up to say Nice Shot! or press right and then down to say Close one!) You can play online with friends or with bots in matches that you made with fun mutator settings, you can play ranked so you can rank up every time you win: ex. Ranking up from silver ||| to gold |. 
            All in all, an amazing game, no reasons you shouldn't get it, many reasons you should get it.</i></p>

                    thing I hate is that it is 
                    full filled with campers, and to 
                    say it right it is easier for 
                    them to camp (now that hearing footsteps is 
                    much easier) also not to forget the 
                    suppresors won't hide you from 
                    the minimap anymore, most of the time 
                    your spot will be revealed by the annoying 
                    walkie talkie voice, which 
                    may be helpful and annoying at the 
                    same time cuz you are hearing, your 
                    footsteps and your 
                    teammates' (which now aren't lower than the enemies),Overall the game is fun."</i></p>

It is full to bursting with content, things to earn and masses of replayability. Though its difficulty may be too high for some, it’s definitely the best Crash Bandicoot has ever been and deserves its place alongside the original trilogy.
